# Community Store add-on for concrete5

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

An open, free and community developed eCommerce system for concrete5

Please refer to the project wiki for extended details - https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/wiki

The goal of this project is to provide a stable, feature rich, highly extensible and customizable 'shopping cart toolkit' for version 8+ of concrete5.
The add-on will work directly with a Bootstrap based theme, primarily Elemental, but is intended to be easily modified and overriden for a custom theme.

## PHP Version
This add-on is intended to be run in a PHP 7 environment.

## Setup
The package can be downloaded, unzipped into the /packages directory (ensuring the folder name is simply 'community_store') and installed via the 'Extend concrete5' option within the dashboard.  It is recommended that a 'release' be used instead of the master branch - https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/releases

## Documentation
Further documentation and how-tos can be found at https://concrete5-community-store.github.io/community_store/
The documentation is automatically generated using https://vuepress.vuejs.org/, from the files within the [docs folder of the master branch](https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store/tree/master/docs).
Pull requests to the documentation are also welcome.

## Payment gateways
To keep the 'core' store component as lightweight as possible it does not include a payment gateway other than the 'Invoice' type.
Payment gateways are to be installed as additional add-ons.

Additional gateways can be found at https://github.com/concrete5-community-store.

## Shipping Methods
The store features two built in shipping methods, but like payment gateways these can be extended with further packages. 
An simple example shipping method has been created for reference and can be found at:
https://github.com/concrete5-community-store/community_store_shipping_example

Further pre-built shipping methods are also available at Additional gateways can be found at https://github.com/concrete5-community-store.
